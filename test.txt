"tips"=>{"health"=>["Don't make the mistake of assuming turkey bacon is healthier than pork bacon. Read the labels and look for short ingredient lists (not too many artificial ingredients
preservatives
and other additives). If you're watching your sodium intake
pay attention to that too. It is also important to note that the American Institute for Cancer Research has stated the consumption of ANY processed meat could increase your risk of developing cancer. Although it is not yet clear what causes the increased cancer risk
it could be the preservatives or other chemicals commonly used during processing."
"You have probably heard by now that whole wheat bread is better for you than white bread. While this is true and definitely worth considering
you should be aware that all bread (especially your typical supermarket loaves) will raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation."
"If you're trying to <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sugar-nutrient\">cut back on sugar</a>
consider replacing some of the sugar in this recipe with a sweetener like Stevia or Splenda. If you're against these kinds of sweeteners
start reducing the amount of real sugar you use until your tastebuds adjust. "]

"cooking"=>["To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions
trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes."
"Surprising tip: you will end up with <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/tip-for-perfect-bacon-add-a-little-water-to-the-pan-191595\">better bacon</a> if you add water to the skillet when cooking it on the stovetop. For large amounts of bacon
you can also prepare bacon in the <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-perfect-bacon-in-the-oven-107970\">oven</a>."
"If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures
make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil
coconut oil
or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."
"If you have too much bacon (is this even possible?) you can freeze individual slices by laying them between sheets of wax paper. Even better
you can put them on a single sheet of wax paper and roll the paper <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Freeze-Bacon\">in such a way</a> that you can just unroll it later and remove however many slices you want."
"You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions
check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy."
"Store brown sugar in an air-tight container to avoid hardening. If your brown sugar still gets too hard to use
you can use one of <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sugar\">these techniques</a> to soften it."
"If a recipe doesn't specify whether you should use light brown sugar or dark brown sugar
just use whatever you have on hand or prefer. The difference is that dark brown sugar has more molasses and thus a stronger flavor."]

such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. One wine you could try is Nickel & Nickel Suscol Ranch Merlot. It has 4.5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 58 dollars."

"title"=>"Nickel & Nickel Suscol Ranch Merlot"
"description"=>"The 2014 Suscol Merlot offers a perfect harmony of juicy and succulent flavors. A small swirl coaxes enticing aromas of dark plum
green olive
and cedar from the glass. Earthy notes of tobacco leaf
olive
tar and spice blend nicely with the dark
sweet fruit. From year to year
this wineâ€™s distinctiveness lies in the lush
velvety tannins that expand upon the initial sip and develop with richness through the finish. This wine pairs beautifully with food and benefits from a little bottle age in your cellar."

be sure to find a brand of gluten-free breadcrumbs."
"Depending on the recipe
you might be able to substitute almond meal or flaxseed for the breadcrumbs to reduce the carbohydrate content and up the nutrition. For example
almond meal works well for breading
while ground flaxseed can help with binding."
"You have probably heard by now that whole wheat bread is better for you than white bread. While this is true and definitely worth considering
you should be aware that all bread (especially your typical supermarket loaves) will raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation."
"If you're worried about cholesterol and heart disease
you may have heard you should limit your egg consumption to one egg per day or eat only egg whites. However
new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health
folic acid is great for brain health
and it has vitamins A
E
D
and K) and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol\">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels."]
"price"=>["Most dairy products stay good well past their sell-by date. Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old
make sure the product smells fine
has a normal texture
and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."]
"cooking"=>["Kosher salt is a type of coarse-grained salt popular among chefs because it is easy to pick up with the fingertips and sticks well when coating meat. The name \"kosher salt\" comes from the word \"koshering\"
the process of making food suitable for consumption according to Jewish law. You can easily substitute table salt or sea salt in recipes where the salt is being dissolved
but if you're using it to coat meat
you might wish you had the kosher salt."]

eggs are generally cheap to begin with
and eggs from cage-free chickens are worth the extra cost."]}

"If you prefer lean meat but want to switch it up
try ground turkey

"Although the body needs salt to survive
most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part
which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet
you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper

"If you find meat (especially grassfed and/or organic meat!) on sale
stock up and <a href\"http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html\">freeze it</a>. Ground meat will stay good 3-4 months
while steaks

"cooking"=>["Make sure you cook ground meat thoroughly. Grinding meat creates a lot of surface area that bacteria can grow on
so eating undercooked ground meat poses a real health risk."

buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much

"Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However
its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke
it begins to break down
producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately
the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil
it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils
canola oil
 coconut oil
and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

Malbec

"description"=>"A decade after its first production
our Merlot has firmly established itself as one of Frog's Leap's most consistently superb varietals. The excellence begins in our vineyards
with the inspired combination of strong-backed
deeply ÃŸavored Carneros fruit and seductively flavored
intensively aromatic fruit from Rutherford. The essence of our dry-farmed
organically-grown fruit is best left simply prepared. From the moment the fruit arrives from the vineyards
our winemaking team instinctively knows that heavy-handed winemaking techniques have no place in their cellar and gently allow the wine to come into its own. Our partnership with the fruit nurtures a wine that possesses a deeply reÃŸective sense of place. Frog's Leap 2000 Merlot is pungent with ripe red fruit aromatics
satisfying with mouth-filling plumy flavors and bracing with a strong tannic spine and bright acidity. It is balanced
supple
harmonious
and elegant. Truly a wine as nature intended."

"tips"=>{"health"=>["With feta cheese
a little goes a long way
so you probably don't need to worry about using low fat varieties (plus
research suggests people who eat full fat dairy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/02/12/275376259/the-full-fat-paradox-whole-milk-may-keep-us-lean\">are thinner</a> than those who eat reduced fat products!)"
"You have probably heard by now that whole wheat bread is better for you than white bread. While this is true and definitely worth considering
you should be aware that all bread (especially your typical supermarket loaves) will raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation."
"You can choose lean ground beef or switch to ground turkey or ground bison if you prefer less fatty meat."
"If you prefer lean meat but want to switch it up
try ground turkey
pork
or even bison!"
"Lycopene
the chemical in tomatoes that makes them red (and healthy)
is fat soluble. This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say
avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!"
"Unfortunately feta cheese is high in sodium
so if you're watching your sodium intake you might need to substitute another cheese. Some say rinsing the cheese also reduces its sodium content."]
"price"=>["The price of ground beef is going up. <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/beans--lentils--and-other-legumes\">Beans and lentils</a>
on the other hand
are both cheap and filling. Depending on the recipe
you might be able to add beans or lentils to stretch out your beef."
"Most dairy products stay good well past their sell-by date. Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old
make sure the product smells fine
has a normal texture
and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."
"If you find meat (especially grassfed and/or organic meat!) on sale
stock up and <a href\"http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html\">freeze it</a>. Ground meat will stay good 3-4 months
while steaks
chops
etc.
will be fine for at least 4 months."]
"cooking"=>["To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions
trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes."
"You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions
check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy."
"Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables
check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>."
"Make sure you cook ground meat thoroughly. Grinding meat creates a lot of surface area that bacteria can grow on
so eating undercooked ground meat poses a real health risk."
"Traditionally
feta cheese is made from sheep's or goat's milk (or a combination of the two). Now some supermarkets sell \"feta-style\" cheeses made from cow's milk. If you want the authentic feta experience
be sure to read the label carefully."]
"green"=>["Choose organic
grassfed beef whenever possible. If you're worried about your grocery budget
try eating a few <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/vegetarian+dinner\">vegetarian meals</a> so you can afford better meat!"
"Tomatoes
especially cherry tomatoes
should be bought <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\">organic</a> when possible. Moreover
buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much
much tastier
not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact
we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet
jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."]}

Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly
the skin will peel right off."
"If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures
make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil
coconut oil

"tips"=>{"health"=>["You can choose lean ground beef or switch to ground turkey or ground bison if you prefer less fatty meat."
"If you prefer lean meat but want to switch it up
try ground turkey
pork
or even bison!"
"Since most of its calories come from fat
sour cream has a bad reputation for being an unhealthy food. However
<a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> is an important part of the diet and studies suggest people who eat full fat dairy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/02/12/275376259/the-full-fat-paradox-whole-milk-may-keep-us-lean\">are thinner</a> than those who reach for reduced fat products. That said
fat has more calories per gram than carbohydrates or protein
so if you are counting calories to lose weight
you might want to try substituting greek yogurt for some of the sour cream in recipes that call for a lot of it."
"Although the body needs salt to survive
most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part
which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet
you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper
herbs
and spices."]
"price"=>["The price of ground beef is going up. <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/beans--lentils--and-other-legumes\">Beans and lentils</a>
on the other hand
are both cheap and filling. Depending on the recipe
you might be able to add beans or lentils to stretch out your beef."
"If you find meat (especially grassfed and/or organic meat!) on sale
stock up and <a href\"http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html\">freeze it</a>. Ground meat will stay good 3-4 months
while steaks
chops
etc.
will be fine for at least 4 months."
"Most dairy products stay good well past their sell-by date. Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old
make sure the product smells fine
has a normal texture
and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."
"Fresh herbs can be expensive
so don't let them go to waste. If you have any leftovers
you might be able to freeze them. The Kitchn recommends <a href=\"http://www.thekitchn.com/freeze-herbs-in-olive-oil-173648\">freezing hardy herbs</a> like rosemary and thyme in olive oil
while Better Homes and Gardens suggests using <a href=\"http://www.bhg.com/recipes/how-to/food-storage-safety/freezing-herbs/\">freezer bags</a> to freeze basil
chives
mint
and more."]
"cooking"=>["To prevent curdling
take sour cream of the fridge well in advance and only add it to hot soups or sauces once it has reached room temperature and once the soup/sauce has cooled down a bit."
"The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice)."
"Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro
basil
and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves
rosemary
and thyme can be added earlier."
"Make sure you cook ground meat thoroughly. Grinding meat creates a lot of surface area that bacteria can grow on
so eating undercooked ground meat poses a real health risk."
"If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures
make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish.

coconut oil
or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."
"Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs
but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  "
"Confused by the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cream\">different types of cream</a> &mdash; Most differences arise from the fat content of the cream
and whether or not the cream has been \"soured\" by adding lactic acid bacteria to give it a tangy flavor."]

keep in mind that the compounds that cause garlic breath also offer a lot of health benefits. Garlic has anti-inflammatory

choose Spanish garlic
which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds)."
"Although the body needs salt to survive
most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part
which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet
you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper
herbs
and spices."]

stock up and <a href\"http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html\">freeze it</a>. Ground meat will stay good 3-4 months

"cooking"=>["If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures
make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil
coconut oil
or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."
"Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly
the skin will peel right off."]
